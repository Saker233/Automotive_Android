Q1:

Questiuon one has 2 parts first one to implement the binary search algorithm and this is the easy part, second part is implementing it with vim editor and this is the hard part

1- first we make source file called binary search and we enter this file with vim

vim has mainly 3 modes
   1 - Normal(Command) mode -> used to control the file with commands
   2 - Insert mode -> used to actual write or edit in the file
   3 - Read Mode -> used to read the file only

So we first enter vim the default mode is the normal mode

but we want to edit and write our own program so we want to switch to insert mode by pressing 'i'

in the insert mode you are free to type and navigate in the whole file freely

After you wrote your program and want to save and exit you have to go back to normal mode again by pressing "ESC"
To make vim let you save and exit we have to write a specific command ":wq" this mean I want to write and quite

So we go back to terminal and compile our file then execute the program easily and we see it working proprely
